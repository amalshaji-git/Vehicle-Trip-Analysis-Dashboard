ransport Operations Dashboard
Project Overview

The Transport Operations Dashboard is a Power BI solution designed to analyze and optimize transportation performance. It provides insights into vehicle trips, driver performance, route efficiency, and distance coverage, helping businesses improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.

Project Objectives

Track trip counts, distance covered, and fuel usage for each vehicle.

Analyze driver performance and identify top and low performers.

Highlight inefficient routes or unusual fuel consumption patterns.

Provide interactive filters to drill down by vehicle, driver, or time period.
