# üöö Transport Operations Dashboard

## üìå Project Overview  
The **Transport Operations Dashboard** is a **Power BI** solution designed to analyze and optimize transportation performance. It provides insights into **vehicle trips**, **driver performance**, **route efficiency**, and **distance coverage**, helping businesses improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives  
- Track **trip counts**, **distance covered**, and **fuel usage** for each vehicle.  
- Analyze **driver performance** and identify top and low performers.  
- Highlight **inefficient routes** or unusual fuel consumption patterns.  
- Provide **interactive filters** to drill down by vehicle, driver, or time period.
